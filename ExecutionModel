Modularity


def main()
     call_func()
     
if __name__ == '__main__'
     main()

if we dont add if clause then the code will not be executed as python script.
In the repl if we try to import the module then its loaded only once.Therefore the __name__ variable will print the module(only once).
If the script is invoked through shell then __name__ evaluates to string '__main__' 
The above will work from repl as well as shell as a python script.
