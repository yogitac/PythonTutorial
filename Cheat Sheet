List:  Mutable sequence of objects
Dict: Mutable mappings of key value pairs
tuple: Immutable sequence of objects
set: unordered collection of items. Every element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (which cannot be changed).

However, the set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it

Frozensets: are like sets, just that they are immutable.
