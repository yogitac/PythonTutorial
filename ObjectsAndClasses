Object represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified.
Objects of the same kind are defined by using a common class

The relationship between classes and objects is analogous to that between an apple-pie recipe and apple pies.
You can make as many apple pies (objects) as you want from a single recipe (class).


An object is an instance of a class, and you can create many instances of a class
